# A data-driven analysis of Argentinian wages and household economics in 2019

The dataset contains demographic and socioeconomic information about Argentina in 2019, subject to certain restrictions and rules. The objective is to perform a detailed analysis of this data to answer a series of questions related to income, education, marital status, employment situation, and other relevant aspects of the population. The primary focus is to understand the various factors that influence the attainment of high salaries, thereby identifying the key determinants in the country's socioeconomic landscape.
